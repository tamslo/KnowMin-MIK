# DONE

- refactor: use *config.py for individual configuration again
- use regex to parse rdf triples
- csv is not inserted properly into db (optionally enclosed by doesn't work??)


# TODO

- hashes
- what needs to be analysed?
  - no. categories
  - no. subjects per category
  - no. distinct pred/obj pairs
  - no. properties
- script for suggestions
- small test data (select entries with many links to other entries)
- small test data (random subset selection)
- organize workflow (command line params, what are different opts?)
- bug in DumpConverter [WARNING: could not match line # started 2014-07-25T21:33:17Z with rdf triple regex] -> one empty database entry (try/catch for regex?)
